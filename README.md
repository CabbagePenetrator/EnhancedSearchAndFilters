# EnhancedSearchAndFilters

A mod that helps you find the songs you want to play quicker! Includes a more option rich search screen and song filtering.

## Features

- Search
     - Auto-refreshing search results
       - Now you don't have to enter the whole title of a song and hope it appears in the search results! You can see what songs match as you're typing in.
     - Searching for song title, author, and map maker
       - Never search for artists or map makers? Further refine search results by disabling search for those fields.
     - Remove symbols
       - Apostrophes, quotations, commas, brackets, etc. can be removed before searching.
- Filter
     - Limit song length, difficulties, and NJS on the song list.
     - More filters coming soon! (hopefully)
- Mod compatibility
     - Compatible with BeatSaverDownloader and SongBrowser.

## Dependencies

- SongCore
- CustomUI
- BS Utils
