## Features

- Search
     - Auto-refreshing search results
       - Now you don't have to enter the whole title of a song and hope it appears in the search results! You can see what songs match as you're typing in.
     - Searching for song title, author, and map maker
       - Never search for artists or map makers? Further refine search results by disabling search for those fields.
     - Symbols
       - Apostrophes, quotations, commas, brackets, etc. can be removed before searching.
       - Or alternatively, symbols can be typed in yourself when trying to find a song with lots of symbols in the title!
- Filter
     - Limit song length, difficulties, and NJS on the song list.
     - Find songs you have voted for (needs BeatSaverDownloader)
     - One Saber, Lightshow, and Mapping Extensions-required songs can be easily found!
- Mod compatibility
     - Compatible with BeatSaverDownloader and SongBrowser.
