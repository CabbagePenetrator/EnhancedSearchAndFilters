## Features

- Search
     - Auto-refreshing search results
       - Now you don't have to enter the whole title of a song and hope it appears in the search results! You can see what songs match as you're typing it in.
     - Search by song title, author, and map maker
       - Never search for artists or map makers? Further refine your search results when you disable searching in those fields.
     - Symbols
       - Apostrophes, quotation marks, commas, brackets, etc. can be removed before searching.
       - Or alternatively, symbols can be typed in yourself when trying to find a song with lots of symbols in the title!
     - Word suggestions
       - While typing, the mod shows you a list of possible words you're trying to type.
- Filter
     - Limit song length, difficulties, and NJS on the song list.
     - Find songs you have voted on (requires the BeatSaverDownloader mod).
     - One Saber, Lightshow, and Mapping Extensions-required songs can be easily found!
     - Show only ranked songs (requires the SongDataCore mod).
     - Frequently download songs and then forget to play them? Filter for songs that you have never played before.
